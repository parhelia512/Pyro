The **🔥 Pyro Game Library (PGL)** is an advanced 2D game development toolkit for [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi), designed to make building games fast, reliable, and powerful. Say goodbye to runtime DLLs—PGL embeds all external dependencies directly into your executable and loads them **entirely in memory**, never saving them to disk. This innovative approach simplifies deployment 📦, enhances security 🔒, boosts performance 🚀, and eliminates compatibility issues, ensuring your games are stable and ready to shine.

Built and tested in **Delphi 12.2** on **Windows 11 24H2**, PGL should work seamlessly with **Delphi 12 CE** or higher. Leveraging the latest technologies, PGL delivers a streamlined workflow with robust features like **memory-efficient IO operations**, **high-performance rendering** for graphics and video 🎨, and **immersive audio playback** 🎵. The direct memory loading design reduces I/O overhead, providing a smooth, optimized experience for your players. 🎮  

With its all-in-one solution, PGL removes the complexity of managing multiple libraries or external dependencies, letting you focus on creating outstanding games. Whether you're crafting your first indie project or a professional-grade title, PGL equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life.

### Getting Started  

1. **Download**: Get the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/tinyBigGAMES/Pyro/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).  
2. **Load the Project**: Open `Pyro Game Library.groupproj` in the `src` folder to access the examples.  
3. **Build the Resource Archive**: Run the `ZipFileIO01` example first. This creates the resource archive used by other examples.  

With its all-in-one solution, PGL removes the complexity of managing multiple libraries or external dependencies, letting you focus on creating outstanding games. Whether you're crafting your first indie project or a professional-grade title, PGL equips you with everything you need to bring your vision to life.
